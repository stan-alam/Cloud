Build and deploy applications from scratch with Docker, Kubernetes & AWS. The step-by-step guide from Beginner to Pro.

Ready to Level Up Your Deployment Skills?

Whether you’re starting from scratch—no Docker knowledge, no automated pipelines, and no idea how to tackle real-world cloud deployments—or you’ve already run a few containers and want to sharpen your production-ready expertise, this journey is for you. It’s not about where you begin; it’s about how far you can go.

Picture yourself just a few weeks from now: you’ve confidently built and run containerized applications, implemented HTTPS to safeguard user data, fine-tuned asset delivery for peak performance, and set up load balancers to ensure your services stay online under heavy demand. You’ve mastered a streamlined continuous deployment flow from GitHub to AWS App Runner, and explored other production-grade solutions like AWS ECS and Kubernetes to diversify your skill set. Every step of the way, you’re moving closer to running deployments that are efficient, resilient, and scalable.

Gain a Future-Proof Skill Set

This isn’t just a checklist of tasks – it’s a transformation in how you think about delivering software. You’ll gain the confidence to ship code without downtime anxiety, adapt quickly to changing traffic patterns, and smooth out your entire development-to-deployment pipeline. The result? A strong, future-proof skill set that can elevate your career and open up new opportunities, whether you’re an absolute beginner or honing your deployment prowess.

Your 25-Day Roadmap:

Days 1–5: Start simple. Run your first Docker container, bring a site live, secure it with HTTPS, and connect it to a custom domain.
Days 6–10: Advance to building production-ready images with Dockerfiles and multi-stage builds. Push these images to private registries and establish a continuous deployment pipeline from GitHub to AWS App Runner.
Days 11–15: Dive deeper into AWS. Manage networking, ensure data persistence, and integrate multi-container apps seamlessly into the cloud.
Days 16–20: Orchestrate multi-service deployments with Docker Compose. Introduce load balancing and gain the confidence to pick your next steps—stay with App Runner or embrace ECS or Kubernetes down the road.
Days 21–25: Pull it all together. Manage advanced configurations, persistent storage, and scaling strategies, ensuring your final environment is truly production-ready.
